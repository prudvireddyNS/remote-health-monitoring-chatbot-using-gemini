Please remember that this information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.

Here are three possible conditions that can manifest with eye redness, along with two common therapeutic approaches for each:

1.  **Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye):**
    *   **Antibiotic Eye Drops/Ointment:** (For bacterial conjunctivitis) Topical antibiotics such as erythromycin or polymyxin B/trimethoprim are commonly prescribed to combat bacterial infections.
    *   **Artificial Tears:** (For viral or allergic conjunctivitis) Lubricating eye drops can help soothe irritation, reduce redness, and flush out allergens or irritants.

2.  **Subconjunctival Hemorrhage:**
    *   **Observation:** In most cases, subconjunctival hemorrhages resolve on their own within 1-3 weeks without specific treatment.
    *   **Artificial Tears:** Can be used for comfort to alleviate any mild irritation.

3.  **Iritis (Anterior Uveitis):**
    *   **Topical Corticosteroids:** Eye drops containing corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate) are often prescribed to reduce inflammation.
    *   **Pupil-Dilating Eye Drops (Cycloplegics):** Medications like atropine or cyclopentolate are used to dilate the pupil, which can help relieve pain and prevent adhesions.
